    <p class="text-lg mt-10">I used to be a professional player in League of Legends. My team, CAF (Chibby and Friends),
      won
      numerous tournaments. It was an amazing experience, filled with excitement, teamwork, and lots of practice.
      Unfortunately, like many others, our team had to part ways during the pandemic. Suddenly, I found myself with a
      lot of free time and no clear direction.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-10">After the team disbanded, I spent a lot of time playing League casually and watching
      movies. While it was fun, I
      started feeling like I was wasting my time. I knew I needed to find something new to focus on, something that
      would challenge me and help me grow.</p>

    <img class="w-4/5 mx-auto mt-10 border-[1px] rounded-lg dark:border-darkborder"
      src="assets/img/blogs/433464977_408065478844142_1993025566133903527_n.jpg" alt="">

    <p class="text-lg mt-10">In August 2023, I stumbled upon coding, and it felt like entering a secret realm I had
      never explored. I was
      surprised I hadn't tried it earlier! Starting with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the more I learned, the more
      captivated I became. Coding feels like solving puzzles, and there's nothing quite like the satisfaction of seeing
      my code work seamlessly.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-10">Since starting in August, I've learned a lot about the basics of coding. I've completed
      several online courses,
      built small projects, and even started contributing to open-source projects. Each step forward feels like a
      victory, much like winning a game.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-10">One of the first challenges I encountered was debugging. I spent hours trying to figure out
      why my code wasn't
      working, only to find out it was a missing semicolon or a misplaced bracket. These moments were frustrating, but
      they taught me the importance of attention to detail and patience.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mt-10">Starting something new can be daunting, especially when you see others who are much more
      experienced. I often
      felt like an imposter, doubting my abilities and questioning if I could ever reach their level. Overcoming this
      mindset was tough, but with time and practice, I started to believe in myself and my progress.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-10">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mt-5 mb-10">As I move forward, I plan to delve into more advanced topics such as backend
      development,
      databases, and perhaps even AI and machine learning. The possibilities in coding are endless, and I'm eager to
      explore them all. I'll keep updating this blog with my progress, challenges, and any tips I learn along the way.
      Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I hope to continue sharing my experiences with you.</p>
